# Overview
Popular cryptographic algorithms for [Dart](https://dart.dev) / [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
developers.

Maintained by Gohilla Ltd. Licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

This package is:
* __Easy to use__. The API is easy to understand and encourages good defaults.
* __Multi-platform__. It's easy to customize implementation of X in platform Y.
* __Fast.__ By default, we use platform APIs when available. For example, SHA-512 is over 100
  times faster than _package:crypto_ in browsers.

Any feedback, issue reports, or pull requests are appreciated!

## Cryptographic keys
The usual arguments to algorithms are:
* [SecretKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretKey-class.html)
  * Used by ciphers, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions.
* [KeyPair](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/KeyPair-class.html)
  * [SimpleKeyPair](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimpleKeyPair-class.html)
    (Byte sequences such as Ed25519 / X25519 32-byte private keys)
  * [EcKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcKeyPair-class.html)
    (P-256, P-384, P-521 private keys)
  * [RsaKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaKeyPair-class.html)
    (RSA private keys)
* [PublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/PublicKey-class.html)
  * [SimplePublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimplePublicKey-class.html)
    (Byte sequences such as Ed25519 / X25519 32-byte public keys)
  * [EcPublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcPublicKey-class.html)
    (P-256 / P-384 / P-512 public keys)
  * [RsaPublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaPublicKey-class.html)
    (RSA public keys)
  
Note that SecretKey and KeyPair instances are opaque and asynchronous by default. They may not be in
the memory and may not be readable at all. If a SecretKey or KeyPair instance is in memory, it's an
instance of one of the following:
* [SecretKeyData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretKeyData-class.html)
* [SimpleKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimpleKeyPairData-class.html)
* [EcKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcKeyPairData-class.html)
* [RsaKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaKeyPairData-class.html)

For encoding/decoding private/public keys in JWK (JSON Web Key) format, use
[package:jwk](https://pub.dev/packages/jwk).
For encoding/decoding X.509, PKCS12, and other formats, we don't have recommended packages
at the moment.

## Cryptographic factory class
The class [Cryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Cryptography-class.html)
has factory methods that return implementations of cryptographic algorithms. The default
implementation is _BrowserCryptography_ (which works in all platforms, not just browser).

We wrote the following three implementations of `Cryptography`:
* [DartCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.dart/DartCryptography-class.html)
    * Gives you implementations written in pure Dart implementations. They work in all platforms.
    * SHA1 / SHA2 uses implementation in [package:crypto](https://pub.dev/packages/crypto), which
      is maintained by Google. The rest of the algorithms in _DartCryptography_ are written and
      tested by us.
    * See the [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.dart/DartCryptography-class.html)
      for list algorithms supported by it.
* [BrowserCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.browser/BrowserCryptography-class.html)
    * Uses [Web Cryptography API](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/) (_crypto.subtle_).
    * The class extends _DartCryptography_.
    * See the [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.browser/BrowserCryptography-class.html)
      for list algorithms supported by it.
* [FlutterCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography_flutter/latest/cryptography_flutter/FlutterCryptography-class.html)
    * A Flutter plugin available in the package
      [cryptography_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter).
      Enabled with [FlutterCryptography.enable()](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography_flutter/latest/cryptography_flutter/FlutterCryptography/enable.html).
    * The class extends _BrowserCryptography_.
    * See the [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography_flutter/latest/cryptography_flutter/FlutterCryptography-class.html)
      for list algorithms supported by it.

# Getting started
In _pubspec.yaml_:
```yaml
dependencies:
  cryptography: ^2.1.1
```

If you use Flutter, you may consider using 
[cryptography_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter) for improving performance.
It moves computations away from the UI isolate.

# Examples
## Digital signature
In this example, we use [Ed25519](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Ed25519-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // The message that we will sign
  final message = <int>[1,2,3];

  // Generate a keypair.
  final algorithm = Ed25519();
  final keyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();

  // Sign
  final signature = await algorithm.sign(
    message,
    keyPair: keyPair,
  );
  print('Signature: ${signature.bytes}');
  print('Public key: ${signature.publicKey.bytes}');

  // Verify signature
  final isSignatureCorrect = await algorithm.verify(
    message,
    signature: signature,
  );
  print('Correct signature: $isSignatureCorrect');
}
```

## Key agreement
In this example, we use [X25519](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/X25519-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final algorithm = X25519();

  // Alice chooses her key pair
  final aliceKeyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();

  // Alice knows Bob's public key
  final bobKeyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();
  final bobPublicKey = await bobKeyPair.extractPublicKey();

  // Alice calculates the shared secret.
  final sharedSecret = await algorithm.sharedSecretKey(
    keyPair: aliceKeyPair,
    remotePublicKey: bobPublicKey,
  );
  final sharedSecretBytes = await aliceKeyPair.extractBytes();
  print('Shared secret: $sharedSecretBytes');
}
```

## Authenticated encryption
In this example, we encrypt a message with [AesCtr](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/AesCtr-class.html)
and append a [Hmac](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Hmac-class.html)
message authentication code.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Message we want to encrypt
  final message = utf8.encode('Hello encryption!');

  // Choose the cipher
  final algorithm = AesCtr(macAlgorithm: Hmac.sha256());

  // Generate a random secret key.
  final secretKey = algorithm.newSecretKey();
  final secretKeyBytes = await secretKey.extractBytes();
  print('Secret key: ${secretKeyBytes}');

  // Encrypt
  final secretBox = await algorithm.encrypt(
    message,
    secretKey: secretKey,
  );
  print('Nonce: ${secretBox.nonce}');
  print('Ciphertext: ${secretBox.cipherText}');
  print('MAC: ${secretBox.mac.bytes}');

  // Decrypt
  final clearText = await algorithm.decrypt(
    secretBox,
    secretKey: secretKey,
  );
  print('Cleartext: ${utf8.decode(clearText)}');
}
```

## Hashing
In this example, we use [Sha512](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Sha512-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final sink = Sha512().newHashSink();

  // Add all parts of the authenticated message
  sink.add([1,2,3]);
  sink.add([4,5]);
  sink.add([6]);

  // Calculate hash
  sink.close();
  final hash = await sink.hash();

  print('SHA-512 hash: ${hash.bytes}');
}
```
